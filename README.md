patch for mysql with updated wolfSSL

MYSQL 5.6.30 can be found at downloads.mysql.com/archives/community/.
Select version "5.6.30" and select platform "source code". This patch was done on the Generic Linux (Architecture Independent), Compressed TAR Archive bundle. mysql-5.6.30.tar.gz

To run the patch, copy wolfssl-mysql-5.6.30.patch into the same directory with current MYSQL source code.
From the terminal in the same direcotry containing current MYSQL source code run
```
    patch -p1 < [directory of]/wolfssl-mysql-5.6.30.patch
```
To build using updated SSL make MYSQL with the command
```
cmake . -DBUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release -DWITH_SSL=bundled (from inside the MYSQL source code directory)
```
Then run the standard make && sudo make install

Note: When building on Linux CFLAGS="-g1" may be needed to work around a Binutils bug. To build then it would be the command
```
CFLAGS="-g1" cmake . -DBUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release -DWITH_SSL=bundled
```
